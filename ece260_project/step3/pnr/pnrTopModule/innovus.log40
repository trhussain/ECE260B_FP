**ERROR: (IMPOAX-820):	The OA features are disabled in the current session of Innovus because the oax shared library could not be loaded properly. This could be because your installation was not properly configured. To enable OA features, exit the current session and re-launch Innovus either after fixing your installation by running the Configure Installation phase, or after setting the OA_HOME variable to point to a proper OA installation. Check the "OpenAccess Installation and Configuration Guide" manual for more information.

 ** Useful skew failure reasons **
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_7__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_43_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_2__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_45_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_6__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_51_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.

 ** Useful skew failure reasons **
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_6__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_9_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_6__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_21_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_6__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_10_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.

 ** Useful skew failure reasons **
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_7__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_43_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_2__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_27_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_6__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_33_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.
The sequential element mac_array_instance/col_idx_7__mac_col_inst/key_q_reg_3_ could not be skewed because the amount of possible skewing is less than 10ps. Use "setUsefulSkewMode -maxSkew true" to commit such moves.

    The RC characteristics of the vias currently used for estimated routes are a poor match those for the vias used in routing.
    Consider setting the following to improve routing correlation:
    	set_ccopt_property generate_nanoroute_vias true

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQRC extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQRC' for lower nodes. Use command 'create_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQRC extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 'core' of instances=34490 and nets=26720 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design core.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-3032):	Because the cap table file was not provided, it will be created internally with the following process info:
