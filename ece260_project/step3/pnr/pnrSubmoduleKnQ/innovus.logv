[03/21 23:45:21     11] Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 65nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
[03/21 23:45:21     11] 	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including tQuantus, IQRC and Quantus QRC extraction.
[03/21 23:45:21     11] 	Capacitance filtering mode(-capFilterMode option of the setExtractRCMode) is 'relAndCoup' for all engines.
[03/21 23:45:21     11] 	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'high'.
[03/21 23:45:21     11] 	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.
[03/21 23:45:21     11] Updating process node dependent CCOpt properties for the 65nm process node.
