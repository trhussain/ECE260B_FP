Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 65nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including tQuantus, IQRC and Quantus QRC extraction.
	Capacitance filtering mode(-capFilterMode option of the setExtractRCMode) is 'relAndCoup' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'high'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.

**WARN: (IMPDC-1629):	The default delay limit was set to 101. This is less than the default of 1000 and may result in inaccurate delay calculation for nets with a fanout higher than the setting.  If needed, the default delay limit may be adjusted by running the command 'set delaycal_use_default_delay_limit'.
